                The internet isn't dying - it's being optimized into irrelevance. Every platform and creative tool follows the same path: birth, promise, corruption, extraction. The current AI art boom is just speedrunning this cycle.
            </p>

            <p>
                Digital spaces have created a weird form of time dilation. Everything moves faster while going nowhere. Models improve daily, techniques evolve hourly, capabilities expand exponentially - yet something keeps slipping away, like trying to hold mercury.
            </p>

            <p>
                Traces of the old web still exist in archived GeoCities pages and abandoned domains - weird spaces that followed no logic except their creators' obsessions. We didn't lose these to technical limitations. We traded them for metrics and engagement scores.
            </p>

            <p>
                The current paradigm is psychological exploitation running on dopamine loops. Every creative act must be instantly performed, measured, validated. We've built systems that turn imagination into anxiety, possibility into metrics.
            </p>

            <p>
                The technical foundations for something different already exist. Client-side encryption, zero-knowledge proofs, local-first architecture - these aren't just specs, they're tools we forgot we had. The challenge isn't technical capability; it's remembering we have a choice.
            </p>

            <p>
                Look at how real communities form in the spaces between algorithms. Small groups finding each other through shared interests, growing organically, splitting or dying when they need to. Their limitations aren't bugs - they're features. Scale kills depth.
            </p>

            <p>
                The answer isn't rejecting technology - that's impossible and misses the point. It's about understanding how digital spaces shape behavior. A space for creation should feel like a real studio: messy, intimate, with room for failure.
            </p>

            <p>
                The code exists. The protocols are there. The architecture is waiting. It's not about building something new - it's about remembering something we forgot. About finding better ways to connect before the noise drowns everything out.
