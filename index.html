                        The internet is being optimized into irrelevance. Every platform and
                        creative tool follows the same path: birth, promise, corruption,
                        extraction. The AI boom that has occurred over the past two years has
                        made this exceedingly worse. There is a strange sense of time dilation
                        online. Everything moves faster while going nowhere. Models improve,
                        techniques evolve, and capabilities expand exponentially.

                        I miss and long greatly for the communities I was raised in. Weird
                        spaces that followed no rules except their users' obsessions. In the
                        process of the internet maturing, becoming acceptable to those who were
                        initially only tourists, we've lost that magic to algorithms, metrics
                        and engagement scores. The current paradigm is psychological
                        exploitation running on dopamine loops. Every creative act must be
                        instantly performed, measured, validated. We've built systems that turn
                        imagination into anxiety, dreams into constant nightmare.

                        Real communities have always formed in the spaces between algorithms.
                        Small groups finding each other through shared interests, growing
                        organically, splitting up and dying when they need to. Forced scale and
                        widespread appeasement kills depth and meaning, replacing genuine
                        connection with metrics.

                        will be my attempt at creating such a space. I hope to share more soon.
